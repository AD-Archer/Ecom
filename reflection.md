Reflection Questions

1. Primary and Foreign Keys: The Database's Backbone
Primary and foreign keys are like the studs and joists of a house, holding everything together. A primary key is a unique ID for each row, like a social security number. A foreign key is like a reference, linking tables together, making sure data is consistent.

2. Joining Tables: A Data Mashup
Joining tables is like combining ingredients in a recipe. You take data from different tables and mix it up to get a new, more powerful dish. By joining tables, you can answer questions like, "What were our top-selling products last month?" or "Which customers spend the most?"

3. Aggregate Functions: Data's Cliff Notes
Aggregate functions are like summarizing a long book. They take a bunch of data and condense it into a single, meaningful number. For example, you can use SUM to find total sales, AVG to find average order value, or COUNT to count the number of orders.

4. Date Functions: Time Travel for Data
Date functions let you travel back and forth in time with your data. You can analyze trends over time, like comparing sales this year to last year, or identify seasonal patterns. It's like having a time machine for your data.

5. Expanding the E-commerce Universe
To add more features to our e-commerce database, we could create tables for things like customer reviews, product categories, shipping information, and marketing campaigns. This would give us a more complete picture of our business and help us make better decisions.
